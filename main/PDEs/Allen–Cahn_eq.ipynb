    "The Allen–Cahn equation is a simple mathematical model for certain phase separation processes. It also serves as a prototypical example for semilinear,  second-order, parabolic partial differential equations. The presence of a small parameter that defines the thickness of interfaces separating different phases makes the analysis challenging.

    "The model was proposed to replace the singular macroscopic treatment of a discontinuous surface with a smooth one. As a result, an interface can be induced by the singularities in the sharp interface description. Currently, the Allen-Cahn equation has been significantly applied to crystal growth, phase transitions, image analysis, grain growth and so forth. Due to its broad application, there is"
